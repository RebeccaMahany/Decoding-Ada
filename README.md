# Decoding-Ada

Toy project for Nabokov's _Ada, or Ardor_.

## Source text

> For their correspondence in the first period of separation, Van and Ada had
invented a code which they kept perfecting during the next fifteen months after
Van left Ardis. ... Codes are a bore to describe; yet a few basic details must
be, reluctantly, given.

> ...

> In the second period of separation, beginning in 1886, the code was radically
altered. Both Van and Ada still knew by heart the seventy-two lines of
Marvell's "The Garden" and the forty lines of Rimbaud's "MÃ©moire." It was from
these two texts that they chose the letters of the words they needed. For
example, l2.11. l1.2.20. l2.8 meant "love," with "l" and the number following
it denoting the line in the Marvell poem, and the next number giving the
position of the letter in that line, l2.11, meaning "eleventh letter in second
line." I hold this to be pretty clear; and when, for the sake of misleading
variety, the Rimbaud poem was used, the letter denoting the line would simply
be capitalized.
